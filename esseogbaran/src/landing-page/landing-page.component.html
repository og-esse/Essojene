      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m currently a frontend developer and creative technologist who loves
        problem solving. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, intuitive
        interfaces. I get a lot of gratitude from seeing my work come to life in
        the browser and make an impact in the real world. I

        My journey started at Wilfrid Laurier University where I studied
        Computer Science and participated in a Hackathon. I worked on a
        connected glove that combined communication, warmth, and contactless
        payments a project that won top prize at a fashion tech hackathon. Since
        then, I’ve brought that same mix of creativity and practicality into my
        real life work.

        At RBC, I’ve shipped tools that directly impact thousands of users from
        a digital mortgage renewal experience that boosted conversions, to an
        investments account flow that modernized a legacy journey, to design
        system work used across the bank to speed up development and improve
        consistency across RBC digital.
      </p>

      <p>
        My toolkit includes Angular, React, Node.js, GraphQL, and tools like
        Storybook and Cypress. I work closely with designers, product managers,
        and backend engineers to ship scalable, maintainable frontends rather
        than one-off UI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I run a creative brand called <strong>JN</strong>,
        where I explore identity and individuality through storytelling and
        technology. I’ve built two browser games
        <a href="https://jngym.jnclo.com/" target="_blank">JNGYM</a> and
        <a href="https://swagshooter.jnclo.com/" target="_blank"
          >Swag Shooter</a
        >
        as playful extensions of that universe. If you’d like to see the code,
        I’m happy to share the repos on request.

      <p>
        I like learning new things in my free time. Last year I taught myself
        how to sew, DJ and roller skate; this year it’s shaders and game
        engines. Whether it’s technology or life skills, I tend to go deep and
        stay curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now I’m looking for roles where I can combine engineering,
        investigation, and showcase my curiousity.

          I love solving puzzles and brain teasers. I actually play Sudoku while
          walking on the treadmill.
