      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer and creative technologist who
        loves problem solving. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple,
        intuitive interfaces. I get a lot of gratitude from seeing my work come
        to life in the browser and make an impact in the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey started at Wilfrid Laurier University where I studied
        Computer Science and participated in a Hackathon. I worked on a
        connected glove that combined communication, warmth, and contactless
        payments—a project that won top prize at a fashion tech hackathon. Since
        then, I’ve brought that same mix of creativity and practicality into my
        real life work.
      </p>

      <p>
        At RBC, I’ve shipped tools that directly impact thousands of users: from
        a digital mortgage renewal experience that boosted conversions, to an
        investments account flow that modernized a legacy journey, to design
        system work used across the bank to speed up development and improve
        consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>But what really keeps me going is system resilience.</strong>
        While I love delivering features, I get a different kind of thrill from
        understanding how systems behave under pressure. When something breaks
        in production, I’m usually the first one digging into logs, tracing
        requests across services, and asking “why” until the root cause is
        clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        My toolkit includes Angular, React, Node.js, and GraphQL, alongside
        operational tools like <strong>Splunk, SQL,</strong> and Cypress. I work
        closely with product managers, security teams, and backend engineers to
        ship scalable, maintainable software rather than just one-off UI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I run a creative brand called <strong>JN</strong>,
        where I explore identity and individuality through storytelling and
        technology. I’ve built two browser games,
        <a href="https://jngym.jnclo.com/" target="_blank">JNGYM</a> and
        <a href="https://swagshooter.jnclo.com/" target="_blank">Swag Shooter</a
        >, as playful extensions of that universe. If you’d like to see the
        code, I’m happy to share the repos on request.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like learning new things in my free time. Last year I taught myself
        how to sew, DJ, and roller skate; this year it’s shaders and game
        engines. Whether it’s technology or life skills, I tend to go deep and
        stay curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now I’m looking for roles where I can combine engineering,
        investigation, and automation to solve critical problems.

        <p>
          I love solving puzzles and brain teasers. I actually play Sudoku while
          walking on the treadmill—multitasking is my default state.
