      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m a frontend developer and creative technologist who loves building
        products that solve real problems and inspire curiosity. My journey
        began with a connected glove that enabled communication, warmth, and
        contactless paymentsâ€”earning top prize in a fashion tech hackathon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, Iâ€™ve brought that same spirit into everything I build. At
        RBC, Iâ€™ve developed tools that directly impact thousands of usersâ€”from a
        mortgage renewal platform that boosted conversions, to internal design
        systems used across the bank.
      </p>

      <p>
        My toolkit includes Angular, React, Node.js, GraphQL, and tools like
        Storybook and Cypress. I work cross-functionally with designers, product
        managers, and backend engineers to build scalable, accessible, and
        user-focused applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, Iâ€™ve launched creative projects under my brand
        <strong>JNNJ</strong>, where I explore identity and individuality
        through storytelling and technology. Iâ€™ve even built two browser games
        from scratchâ€”<a href="https://jngym.jnclo.com/" target="_blank"
          >JNGYM</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://swagshooter.jnclo.com/" target="_blank">Swag Shooter</a
        >â€”designed to be playful extensions of that brand. (Want a peek at the
        code? Iâ€™m happy to share access to the repo on request.)
      </p>

      <p>
        I thrive on learning. Last year, I taught myself how to sew and DJ. This
        year, itâ€™s shaders and game engines. Whether itâ€™s technology or life
        skills, I dive deep and stay curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the best way to face uncertainty isnâ€™t to avoid itâ€”itâ€™s to
        innovate through it. I donâ€™t just adapt to change; I embrace and lead
        it.

        <p>
          I love puzzles and brain teasers â€” I actually play Sudoku while
          walking on the treadmill!
