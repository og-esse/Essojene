      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with a solid foundation in computer
        science, driven by a commitment to problem-solving and innovation. My
        journey began as a student when I designed a connected glove capable of
        communication, heating, and contactless payments â€” a project that earned
        me first place in a fashion tech hackathon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, Iâ€™ve sharpened my technical skills through academic and
        professional experiences, continuously learning and growing. Currently,
        Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer at RBC, where Iâ€™ve contributed to impactful
        projects such as the mortgage renewal tool, which increased user
        engagement by 15% and conversion rates by 20%.
      </p>

      <p>
        My tech stack includes modern frameworks like Angular, React, and
        Node.js, as well as cloud platforms like Azure. Iâ€™m deeply invested in
        continuous learning, having pursued advanced training in secure coding,
        Docker, and Kubernetes.
      </p>

      <p>
        What excites me most is the opportunity to apply both my technical and
        interpersonal skills to create meaningful solutions, collaborate with
        diverse teams, and drive impactful business outcomes. Iâ€™m particularly
        enthusiastic about roles that align with my passion for innovation,
        collaboration, and creating real value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, one of my biggest passions is vlogging. It offers me a
        creative outlet to share my journeyâ€”whether itâ€™s exploring new hobbies,
        discovering fresh passions, or simply capturing lifeâ€™s small moments.
        Even with a modest audience, I love inspiring others by sharing my
        experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning is at the core of who I am. I donâ€™t just acquire new skillsâ€”I
        immerse myself in them. For example, last year I taught myself how to
        sew and DJ purely out of curiosity. This same drive fuels my
        professional life, where I thrive on pushing boundaries and exploring
        new technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe that the best way to face risks and uncertainty isnâ€™t to avoid
        them, but to innovate through them. I donâ€™t just adapt to change; I
        actively initiate it.

        <p>
          I love puzzles and brain teasers â€” in fact, I often play Sudoku while
          on the treadmill!
