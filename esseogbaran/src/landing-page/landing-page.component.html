      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a frontend developer and creative technologist who enjoys turning
        complex problems into simple, intuitive interfaces. I care about the
        details performance, accessibility, and how the product actually feels
        for the person using it.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey started with a connected glove that combined communication,
        warmth, and contactless payments a project that won top prize at a
        fashion tech hackathon. Since then, I’ve brought that same mix of
        creativity and practicality into production work.
      </p>

      <p>
        At RBC, I’ve shipped tools that directly impact thousands of users from
        a digital mortgage renewal experience that boosted conversions, to an
        investments account flow that modernized a legacy journey, to design
        system work used across the bank to speed up development and improve
        consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        My toolkit includes Angular, React, Node.js, GraphQL, and tools like
        Storybook and Cypress. I work closely with designers, product managers,
        and backend engineers to ship scalable, maintainable frontends rather
        than one-off UI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I run a creative brand called <strong>JN</strong>,
        where I explore identity and individuality through storytelling and
        technology. I’ve built two browser games
        <a href="https://jngym.jnclo.com/" target="_blank">JNGYM</a> and
        <a href="https://swagshooter.jnclo.com/" target="_blank"
          >Swag Shooter</a
        >
        as playful extensions of that universe. If you’d like to see the code,
        I’m happy to share the repos on request.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like learning new mediums as much as new frameworks. Last year I
        taught myself how to sew and DJ; this year it’s shaders and game
        engines. Whether it’s technology or life skills, I tend to go deep and
        stay curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now I’m looking for frontend roles where I can own meaningful
        pieces of the product, collaborate with a strong team, and keep pushing
        what’s possible in the browser.

        <p>
          I love puzzles and brain teasers. I actually play Sudoku while walking
          on the treadmill.
